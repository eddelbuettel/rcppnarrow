### What and Why

The [arrow](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=arrow) package is featureful but can be a little
challenging to install (from source, on Linux, for CI, ...).  The
[narrow](https://github.com/paleolimbot/narrow) package (also named at earlier times, respectively,
`arrowc`, `arrowvctrs`, `carrow` and `sparrow`) provides a very clean and dependency-free interface
for (portable) C interface of Arrow.  Our [fork of narrow](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/narrow)
adds support for C-level access from another package---which is what we test and demonstrate here.

The [narrow](https://github.com/paleolimbot/narrow) package, following on its earlier five names,
now morphed into the [arrow-nanoarrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow) package which the
[RcppNanoarrow](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppnanoarrow) package tracks.

### What

Because neither [narrow](https://github.com/paleolimbot/narrow) nor our [fork of
narrow](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/narrow) are on CRAN, this package uses the forked version
via `Suggests:` which would normally prevent compile-time access---but we use the same approach of
detecting in `configure` if `narrow` is present and if so enabling the extended build.

So in essence we construct a 'Suggested LinkingTo:' that is optional rather than the hard dependency
imposed by an _unconditional_ 'LinkingTo'.
(Note that this is not a new trick; [RcppRedis](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=RcppRedis) has used
[RcppMsgPack](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=RcppMsgPack) as an optional package-build-time
resource in the same way.)
